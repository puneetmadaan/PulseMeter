What files are available:

 . an Arduino electronic circuit schema made on Fritzing (used a photoresistor
   component in stead of the phototransistor.)
 . an Arduino sketchbook sampling and sending on serial line the value of
   the phototransistor.
 . a Python program that display the pulse curve and estimate pulse rate. This
   program is based on GTK.
 . a mount ring designed using Sketchup and exported as a stl file. This file
   can be used to print it using a RepRap for instance.
