=== PulseMeter ===

A simple pulse meter circuit for Arduino inspired by medical oximeter design.
This circuit is based on an IR led and an IR phototransistor.

What is available:

 . an Arduino electronic circuit schema made on Fritzing,
 . an Arduino sketchbook sampling and sending on serial line the value of
   the phototransistor
 . a Python program that display the pulse curve and estimate pulse rate. This
   program is based on GTK.
